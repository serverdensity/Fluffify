Fluffify for Chrome
==================

Coorporate phrases and 'enterprise' words turn our stomach. Unfortunately other people write them, but with technology we're not completely helpless! We've devised a Chrome plugin to replace the terms we're so sick and tired of hearing - to an equivalent (that we're not).

## Contribute

We've made *Fluffify for DevOps teams*, in keeping with that we've also open sourced it. As part of the DevOps community why not add to the list of words that we're banning from our browsers: 

Go ahead and make a pull request to [add more words](https://github.com/serverdensity/Fluffify/tree/master/fluffify/data) to share with the DevOps community.

## How to use

Fluffify is really simple:

* [Download Fluffify for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fluffify/mmihnpeogpiailhfefflbeannjgimapg)
* Enable the plugin
* Refresh your webpage
* We'll replace the words and highlight the changes.
* Go check out a website like [this one](http://www.kimballgroup.com/category/business-intelligence-and-data-warehouse-articles/)

### Optional

1. Toggle the plugin on and off.
2. Add and remove from your list of local words to change from the Fluffify Options menu. `Chrome > Settings > Extensions > Fluffify Options`.

Inspired by the famous extension 'Cloud-to-butt', [XKCD #1288](http://xkcd.com/1288/) and Clarke's third law; "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".
